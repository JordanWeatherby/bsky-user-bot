# Bluesky user bot

The code for https://bsky.app/profile/hourlybskyusers.bsky.social bot. 

It fetches the user count from https://bsky.jazco.dev/stats and runs on a cron job to post every hour.


Heavily based on the template provided by bluesky https://github.com/bluesky-social/cookbook/tree/main/ts-bot
